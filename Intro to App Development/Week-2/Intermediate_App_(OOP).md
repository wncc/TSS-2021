# Usage of OOP in Flutter Apps

In case you're not familiar with the **Object Oriented Programming** method while making the calculator App you might have noticed that your code was getting very long 
and its readability was being reduced.
You might have writen your code in a single file and the functions that you defined were being called in separate places. Such a method of programming is known as **Procedural** programming.

To make our code more organised we try to modularise small chunks of our code using **Abstractions**. 

For example while making a flutter App if you need to use Buttons at various places and you want that each button should be of different colour, it would be really 
cool if you could just define a custom class for your button with properties such as Button color, Text size, font etc. Now you just need to use your own Button class in your main file.
It's like creating your own data type. You can now create your own button and specify its properties very easily.

For week-2 you need to watch **Videos from 16-21.** In video 18 at 1:10 sec he explains why he's making a custom class. What he's doing is precisely an abstraction!

Video 16-17 are not related to OOP and they'll teach you about stateful widgets and Lists. Video 18-19 demonstrate the use of **Abstractions**.
