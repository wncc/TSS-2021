# Week 4
We hope that everything till week 3 is clear to you. 

You have now learnt how to create basic apps in flutter eg. a calculator. Then you also got familiar with flutter developer packages and how to integrate and use them in your app to decrease your workload by using already written code for a specific purpose. And then you were intorduced to API, without which, an app cannot get data from the web, and a brief introduction of Firebase and its services was given to you.

This week is further more interesting. The concepts covered in this week will enable your app to store data in an realtime server (Firebase Realtime Database), use a Sign Up and Log In system to create and authenticate users and possibly verify users using OTP/Email Links(Firebase Authentication).

These topics comes handy when you wish to create an app which uses user login and stores user data in a database.
For Example - 
* Synchronized Todo App - Stores the tasks of a user in a database and synchronises it between Android/iOS/Web Devices.
* Social Media App - Stores the profile data of a user, his posts, no. of likes on his post,  posts liked by him, etc. 

These are just basic ideas of the apps that can you build using Firebase.

## Adding Firebase to your Flutter app
Make sure you connect Firebase with your Flutter app and integrate the Firebase SDKs too.
You can follow the steps given [here](https://medium.com/enappd/adding-firebase-to-your-flutter-app-281b8f391b47).

## Realtime database
Your app will often need to store data.
Firebase provides a database called Realtime database.

In this database, the data is stored in the JSON format.
You can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuFdz8f-cT4) 10 min video which explains the JSON format.

Then follow the tutorial [here](https://medium.com/firebase-tips-tricks/how-to-use-firebase-queries-in-flutter-361f21005467).
It shows how to access data from a Flutter app.

## Authentication
You can also use Firebase to authenticate and verify users with their Gmail, Apple ID, email etc.
Follow the tutorial [here](https://medium.com/firebase-tips-tricks/how-to-use-firebase-authentication-in-flutter-50e8b81cb29f).
