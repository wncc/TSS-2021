## ***WnCC & Career Cell bring to you a course on Introduction to App Development!***
Have you ever wanted to build beautiful android/iOS applications? You can learn to craft user friendly beautiful apps within a month! Flutter is a frontend framework developed by Google to quickly build crossplatform apps for android/iOS/Linux/Windows/Mac. Compared to its counterparts like React Native, Swift and Java, Flutter is much easier to learn and use. Flutter supports a fast app development process hence it saves a lot of time that goes into getting your application from start to finish. Flutter is relatively a newer framework compared to React Native but there is an increasing demand of Flutter for App Development. By the end of this course, you will be fluently programming in Dart and be ready to build your own Flutter apps.

**Pre-Requisites:** Some basic programming knowledge would be beneficial along with a working computer onto which you can install Flutter. Apart from that we just need a great amount of enthusiasm from your side.
