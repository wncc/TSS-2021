# Assignment for Week-3

This week's assignment is optional and here is the link for the solution: https://github.com/SarthakM320/Climate_App.

You can clone the repo and take hints for the assignment.

So for this week we learn about APIs so now we will be creating a ***Weather App*** using the Api offered by https://openweathermap.org/current (You will need to create an account for the api key) . Feel free to Explore the Api doc
and get to know more. You will be getting a json file as a product from the api and you will need a jsondecoder. Go through the code provided once to see the structure once.
